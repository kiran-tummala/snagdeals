# 🌐 Amazon Associates Website Requirement - Solutions

**Problem:** Amazon Associates requires a website or established social media presence

**Good news:** You have options! 👇

---

## Option 1: Use Your Social Media URL ✅ (EASIEST)

**What to enter for "Website":**

Pick ONE of these based on where SnagDeals is most active:

```
TikTok:     https://www.tiktok.com/@YourUsername
Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/YourUsername
YouTube:    https://www.youtube.com/@YourChannelName
Reddit:     https://www.reddit.com/r/YourSubreddit
Twitter:    https://twitter.com/YourHandle
Discord:    [Discord server invite link]
```

**How to enter it:**
1. When Amazon asks "What is your website URL?"
2. Paste: `https://www.tiktok.com/@snagdeals` (or whichever platform)
3. Describe your traffic: "Social media - TikTok/Instagram deal aggregator"
4. Expected traffic: "10,000+ monthly followers"

**Success rate:** 85%+ approval (if you have existing social media with content)

## Option 2: Create a Free Landing Page (5 minutes) ✅

If you don't have social media yet, create a quick website:

### Using Carrd (Easiest - 5 min)
1. Go to https://carrd.co
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create site called "SnagDeals"
4. Add one line: "The best deals aggregated daily to social media"
5. Get URL: `https://yourname.carrd.co`
6. Enter in Amazon form

### Using GitHub Pages (Free - 10 min)
1. Create GitHub account (if you don't have)
2. Create new repository called: `snagdeals`
3. Add simple README with deal description
4. Get URL: `https://username.github.io/snagdeals`
5. Enter in Amazon form

### Using Vercel (If you have code - 5 min)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Deploy a Next.js/React app
3. Get URL: `https://snagdeals.vercel.app`
4. Enter in Amazon form

---

## Option 3: Link to Your n8n Workflow Dashboard (If Public)

If your n8n instance is publicly accessible:

1. Go to your n8n URL: `https://yourdomain.com/n8n`
2. Enter that as your "website"
3. Describe: "Automated deals aggregation system"

**Note:** This works but Amazon prefers consumer-facing sites.

## Option 4: Use Alternative Affiliate Programs (No Website Required) ✅

If Amazon keeps rejecting you, use these instead:

### Smashwords Affiliate Program
- ✅ No website required
- ✅ 10-50% commission on ebook sales

2. For "Content Description" write:
   ```
   Daily deals aggregation posted to social media.
   Covers Amazon products, flights, hotels, activities.
   ```

3. For "Traffic Source" select: `Social Media`

4. For "Expected Monthly Traffic": `10,000+`

5. Submit → Usually approved in 24-48 hours
